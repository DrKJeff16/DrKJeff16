## My Coding

I always favour my code built with a functional/procedural architecture in mind, rather than OOP.
That being said, I'll always be _reasonably_ flexible and adaptive.

I am a very pro-documentation developer, so docstrings, annottations for LSPs, explicit type declaration
and focusing on making code **readable** and **understandable** to others is my thing.
Making my code as simple, yet understandable is my priority, so deep nesting and useless/redundant
operations are some of the things I'll be avoiding like the plague.
