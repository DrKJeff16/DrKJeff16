<h2 id="coding">My Coding</h2>

I always favour my code built with a functional/procedural architecture in mind, rather than OOP.
That being said, I'll always be <u><i>reasonably</i></u> flexible and adaptive.
<br>
I am a very pro-documentation developer, so docstrings, annottations for LSPs, explicit type declaration
and focusing on making code <b><u>readable</u> and </b><b><u>understandable</u></b> to others is my thing.
Making my code as simple, yet understandable is my priority, so deep nesting and useless/redundant
operations are some of the things I'll be avoiding like the plague.
