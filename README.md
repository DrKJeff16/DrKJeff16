## About Me

Hi! I'm a 24 year-old IT student. I love [free software](https://fsf.org) and open-source software.
I aspire to be a developer and/or sysadmin.

I am mostly self-taught, but care to read the documentation for any new stuff.

### Additional Information

- ES / EN / RU
- [Neovim](https://github.com) user
- _I use Arch BTW_
- **_Document your code_**
- FOSS and GNU+Linux shill
- I don't use Windows as my dev environment, nor do I endorse WSL
- My hobbies are playing PvE/Single-Player games and listening to lots of music

## My Coding

I always favour my code built with a functional/procedural architecture in mind, rather than OOP.
That being said, I'll always be _reasonably_ flexible and adaptive.

I am a very pro-documentation developer, so docstrings, annottations for LSPs, explicit type declaration
and focusing on making code **readable** and **understandable** to others is my thing.
Making my code as simple, yet understandable is my priority, so deep nesting and useless/redundant
operations are some of the things I'll be avoiding like the plague.

### My Programming Languages

- Lua
- Shellscript (**BASH** predominantly)
- Python
- C
- C++
- Common-Lisp
- Java
