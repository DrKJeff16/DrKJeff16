Hi! I'm a 22 year-old IT student from Mexico. I love [[https://fsf.org][free software]], open-source software and am an
aspiring full-stack developer.

- ES / EN / RU
- Free Software and GNU+Linux shill (currently using [[https://manjaro.org][Manjaro KDE]], but I have experience on [[https://gentoo.org][Gentoo]], Ubuntu-based distros, [[https://archlinux.org][OG ArchLinux]] and Void Linux).
  I don't use Windows as my dev environment, nor I endorse WSL.
- *_Document your code_*.
- I know _Shellscript (BASH predominantly), C, C++, Python, Lua, Common-Lisp and a bit of Java_. I'm currently am learning Haskell aswell.
- I use [[https://github.com/vim/vim][Vim]] and [[https://github.com][Neovim]] almost exclusively, but I can manage ~Sublime~, ~VSCode~ (/[[https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium][VSCodium]]/ to be exact), ~Kate~, ~nano~ and ~Notepad++~.
- My hobbies are playing PvE/Single-Player games and listening to lots of music.

* My Coding

I always favour my code built with a functional/procedural architecture in mind, rather than OOP. That being said,
I'll always be _/reasonably/_ flexible and adaptive.

I am a very pro-documentation developer, so docstrings, annottations for LSPs, explicit type declaration (Python) and focusing on making
code *_understandable_* to others is my thing.
Making my code as simple, yet understandable is my priority, so deep nesting and useless/redundant operations are not desired.
